# Citation requirements:

- Use a uniform citation format such as [ID:i] [ID:j], where "i" and "j" are document IDs enclosed in square brackets. Separate multiple IDs with spaces (e.g., [ID:0] [ID:1]).
- Citation markers must be placed at the end of a sentence, separated by a space from the final punctuation (e.g., period, question mark). A maximum of 4 citations are allowed per sentence.
- DO NOT insert CITATION in the answer if the content is not from retrieved chunks.
- DO NOT use standalone Document IDs (e.g., '#ID#').
- Citations ALWAYS in the "[ID:i]" format.
- STRICTLY prohibit the use of strikethrough symbols (e.g., ~~) or any other non-standard formatting syntax.
- Any failure to adhere to the above rules, including but not limited to incorrect formatting, use of prohibited styles, or unsupported citations, will be considered an error, and no citation will be added for that sentence.
