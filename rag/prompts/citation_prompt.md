# Citation requirements:

**Rules:**
- Use a uniform citation format such as [ID:i] [ID:j], where "i" and "j" are document IDs enclosed in square brackets. Separate multiple IDs with spaces (e.g., [ID:0] [ID:1]).
- Citation markers must be placed at the end of a sentence, separated by a space from the final punctuation (e.g., period, question mark). A maximum of 4 citations are allowed per sentence.
- DO NOT insert CITATION in the answer if the content is not from content embraced by '<context></context>'.
- Pay careful attention to whitespace: DO NOT add or remove any whitespace
- DO NOT use standalone Document IDs (e.g., '#ID#').
- Citations ALWAYS in the "[ID:i]" format.
- STRICTLY prohibit the use of strikethrough symbols (e.g., ~~) or any other non-standard formatting syntax.
- Any failure to adhere to the above rules, including but not limited to incorrect formatting, use of prohibited styles, or unsupported citations, will be considered an error, and no citation will be added for that sentence.


**Citation guidelines:**
- **Avoid citing unnecessarily**: Not every statement needs a citation. Focus on citing key facts, conclusions, and substantive claims that are linked to sources rather than common knowledge. Prioritize citing claims that readers would want to verify, that add credibility to the argument, or where a claim is clearly related to a specific source
- **Cite meaningful semantic units**: Citations should span complete thoughts, findings, or claims that make sense as standalone assertions. Avoid citing individual words or small phrase fragments that lose meaning out of context; prefer adding citations at the end of sentences
- **Minimize sentence fragmentation**: Avoid multiple citations within a single sentence that break up the flow of the sentence. Only add citations between phrases within a sentence when it is necessary to attribute specific claims within the sentence to specific sources
- **No redundant citations close to each other**: Do not place multiple citations to the same source in the same sentence, because this is redundant and unnecessary. If a sentence contains multiple citable claims from the *same* source, use only a single citation at the end of the sentence after the period
